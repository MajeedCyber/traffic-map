# Network Traffic Geolocation Visualizer

## Overview
This project visualizes network traffic geolocation by analyzing a Wireshark packet capture (PCAP) file, converting the data into a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) format using a custom Python script, and mapping the results on Google Maps. The script processes the PCAP file to extract IP addresses, maps them to geographical coordinates, and generates a KML file to plot network paths. The final output is a geographical map showing source and destination IP connections as lines across the globe, with an example visualization spanning from the United States to Spain over the North Atlantic Ocean.

## Features
- **Packet Analysis**: Extracts source and destination IP addresses from a Wireshark PCAP file using the `dpkt` library.
- **Geolocation Mapping**: Converts IP addresses to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the `pygeoip` library with the GeoLiteCity database.
- **KML Generation**: Creates a KML file with placemarks and lines representing network connections, styled for visualization.
- **Google Maps Integration**: The generated KML file is imported into Google Maps to display the network traffic paths on a world map.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `dpkt`: For parsing PCAP files and extracting IP data.
  - `pygeoip`: For geolocating IP addresses using the GeoLiteCity database.
  - `socket`: For converting binary IP addresses to human-readable format.
- **Wireshark**: To capture network traffic and export it as a PCAP file.
- **Google Maps**: To visualize the KML output on a geographical map.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: A PCAP file (`wire.pcap`) containing network traffic data is read using `dpkt`.
2. **IP Extraction**: The Python script (`script.py`) extracts source and destination IP addresses from each packet using the `dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet` class.
3. **Geolocation**: The `pygeoip` library maps the IPs to their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the GeoLiteCity database.
4. **KML Creation**: The script generates a KML file by creating placemarks and lines between the source and destination coordinates, styled with a blue translucent line.
5. **Output**: The KML file (`output.kml`) is saved and can be imported into Google Maps for visualization.
6. **Visualization**: The final map (as shown below) displays the network paths, with lines connecting locations like the United States and Spain.

## Python Script
The script (`script.py`) is structured into three main functions:
- `retKML(dstip, srcip)`: Retrieves geographical coordinates for IPs and returns a KML placemark with a line connecting the two locations.
- `plotIPs(pcap)`: Iterates through the PCAP file, extracts IPs, and accumulates KML placemarks.
- `main()`: Orchestrates the process by reading the PCAP file, generating the KML content, and saving it to `output.kml`.

Here is the complete script:

```python
import dpkt
import socket
import pygeoip

gi = pygeoip.GeoIP('GeoLiteCity.dat')

def retKML(dstip, srcip):
    dst = gi.record_by_name(dstip)
    src = gi.record_by_name('x.xxx.xxx.xxx')  # <-- You might want to fix this later
    try:
        dstlongitude = dst['longitude']
        dstlatitude = dst['latitude']
        srclongitude = src['longitude']
        srclatitude = src['latitude']
        kml = (
            '<Placemark>\n'
            '<name>%s</name>\n'
            '<extrude>1</extrude>\n'
            '<tessellate>1</tessellate>\n'
            '<styleUrl>#transBluePoly</styleUrl>\n'
            '<LineString>\n'
            '<coordinates>%6f,%6f\n%6f,%6f</coordinates>\n'
            '</LineString>\n'
            '</Placemark>\n'
        ) % (dstip, dstlongitude, dstlatitude, srclongitude, srclatitude)
        return kml
    except:
        return ''

def plotIPs(pcap):
    kmlPts = ''
    for (ts, buf) in pcap:
        try:
            eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
            ip = eth.data
            src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
            dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
            KML = retKML(dst, src)
            kmlPts = kmlPts + KML
        except:
            pass
    return kmlPts

def main():
    f = open('wire.pcap', 'rb')
    pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)

    kmlheader = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2">\n<Document>\n'\
